# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Antonio del Corral

I'm a systems developer with a focus on performance, low-level programming, and technical clarity.

I started my journey at 42, where I spent years writing software from scratch in C and C++ â€” no frameworks, no shortcuts. I learned to build custom shells, HTTP servers, and multi-threaded systems by diving deep into memory, concurrency, and how things really work under the hood.

Later, I moved into the cloud and data world, building efficient architectures on GCP and AWS, and helping teams migrate complex systems from legacy platforms. But even there, I brought a systems mindset: thinking in terms of memory, execution time, and long-term maintainability.

What drives me is understanding what's happening when you're *not* looking. Where every cycle goes. What gets lost in abstraction â€” and how to bring that knowledge back to help others.

## ðŸ“š I believe in:

- Leaving systems better than I found them  
- Teaching through doing â€” and measuring what matters  
- Writing code that doesn't just work, but works well

**Fast, simple, and under control. Thatâ€™s how I like my code.**
